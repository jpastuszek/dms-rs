# dms-rs

This is my attempt on rewriting my distributed monitoring system prototype from Ruby into Rust.
I think Rust will be much better language to implement this systems monitoring component.

To build you need installed:
* rust v1.1
* nanomsg v0.5-beta
* capnp v0.5.2

This can be installed with **brew** on MacOS
